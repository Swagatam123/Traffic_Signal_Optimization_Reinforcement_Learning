Reinforcement Learning based Urban Traffic Control System

Abstract :
This study demonstrates a reinforcement learning based traffic control system which can be applied in urban areas. The objective of the algorithms implemented is to calculate a phase time for traffic signal at an intersection so that the waiting time and average queue length at a stop-line of traffic signal is reduced. ANYLOGIC software is used for simulating a road network consisting of six intersections to test the efficiency of the algorithms for calculating an optimal phase time for each of the traffic signal. In the paper a comparative analysis of three reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm has been shown. It is observed that they fare better than static phase time implementation of traffic signals.
 Problem Statement:
 The unprecedented rise in the number of vehicles compared to expansion of road network have led to the problem of traffic congestion all across the world. “Traffic congestion during peak hours in four major cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata — costs the economy Rs 1.47 lakh crore annually, according to a study conducted by global consultancy firm.”-a TOI report April,2018. The obvious solution is to expand the road network but being a developing nation it is not that financially feasible. So the next best option is to implement a method which can regulate traffic properly and efficiently so as to decrease traffic congestion as much as possible. Currently, traffic signal phase times are static in India. Therefore, in this paper we try to implement RL algorithms to make the traffic signal phase times adaptive by using the traffic state information by sensors of traffic signal and the neighboring information given by traffic signals of other intersections. Using this adaptive traffic signal variation we aim to reduce the traffic congestion.
 
 So we have tried to solve the problem with the help of Reinforcement Learning by taking three different algorithms into considerations and proposed an analysis about their performance.
